                        <p>Their relationship endured the separation caused by Rizal's studies abroad, his travels, and his revolutionary activities. Sadly, their love story ended tragically when Leonor's family, frustrated by the endless engagement, arranged her marriage to Henry Kipping in 1895—a betrayal that deeply wounded Rizal.</p>
                        <p>Despite the heartbreak, Leonor remained his greatest love. His letters to her reveal a man torn between personal desire and national duty.</p>
